# Weather-within-climate in Central America

This repository contains datasets of the date for onset of the rainy season
in Central America. The onset determination is based on the metholodgy of 
Martinez et al. 2022 and it was adapted for gridded datasets (as CHIRPS) including information of the annual rainfall cycle in Central America (García-López et al. in preperation).
